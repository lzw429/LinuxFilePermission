This linux program has three functions. 
Reading the permissions of the file, changing the permissions of the file, and changing the file owner and its user group.
Changing the file permissions, you need to enter a three octal number, which is similar to the use of chmod().
Changing the file owner and its user group, you need to enter two integers, which is similar to the use of chown().
